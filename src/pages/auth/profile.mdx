# Overview

User account management is a critical aspect of many applications, especially those that involve user authentication
and personalized experiences.

We've implemented the profile and password management features.

## Profile management

This method allows a user to change his name, email address, and addresses. There are two types of addresses which are: **delivery address** and **billing address**.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="auth/profile.js"
const axios = require('axios');
let data = JSON.stringify({
  "name": "John S Collins",
  "email": "john.s.collins@fakemail.com",
  "address": {
    "delivery": [
      {
        "city": "Wisconsin(WI)",
        "country": "Togo",
        "phone": "+1(608) 348-3384",
        "street": "350 Virgin Ave Platteville",
        "zip_code": "53818"
      }
    ]
  }
});

let config = {
  method: 'patch',
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/customers/6485c35814c402ee08ec6294',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  data
};

axios.request(config)
.then((response) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});

```

## Password management

This method in the API allows a user to change his password.
The user needs to provide the current password along with the new password.
The API validates that the provided current password matches the one stored in the database and that the new password meets the requirement of at least 8 alphanumeric characters.

If the password update is successful, the API responds with HTTP status code 204. In case the new password does not
meet the requirements, a 400 error code is returned. For validation errors, the API returns a 422 error code.


```js copy showLineNumbers filename="auth/password.js"
const axios = require('axios');
let data = JSON.stringify({
  "current": "Fake:strore@password",
  "password": "1p@sswor{]"
});

let config = {
  method: 'patch',
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/password',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  data : data
};

axios.request(config)
.then((response) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
