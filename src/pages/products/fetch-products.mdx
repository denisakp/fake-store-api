# Fetch all products

The "allProduct" method allows a user to retrieve the list of products. If the operation is successful,
the API responds with a response containing a status code of 200 and a response body with the list of products. In case of an error,
the API returns a status code of 500.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="products/fetch-product.js"
const axios = require('axios');

let config = {
  method: 'get',
  url: 'https://fakestoreapi.denisakp.me/api/products/',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json'
  }
};

axios.request(config)
.then((response) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});

```

Here's an example of the API's response when everything goes smoothly.

```json copy filename="API Response"
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "64858a3114c402ee08ec6293",
            "name": "iPhone X",
            "description": "The iPhone X is a smartphone designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is part of the eleventh generation of the iPhone",
            "stock": 13,
            "price": 450.99,
            "images": [

            ],
            "categories": [
                "smartphone",
                "iphone"
            ],
