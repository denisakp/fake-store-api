# Update a Product

This method allows modification of a product based on its ID. To update a product,
you need to specify the fields you wish to modify along with their new values. If the request is successful,
the API responds with a status code of 200, along with the updated object containing its new values. In case of validation errors,
such as providing a non-existent property in the model, incorrect data type for a property,
or an invalid ObjectId for the ID, the API returns a 422 status code. Additionally,
if the provided ID does not correspond to any product in the database, the API returns a 400 status code.

```js copy showLineNumbers filename="products/update-product.js"
const axios = require('axios');
let data = JSON.stringify({
  "price": 1099.99,
  "stock": 20,
  "name": "Iphone X Max"
});

let config = {
  method: 'patch',
  maxBodyLength: Infinity,
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/products/64858a3114c402ee08ec6293',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  data : data
};

axios.request(config)
.then((response) => {
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data));
})
.catch((error) => {
  console.log(error);
});
```

<Callout>
    Upon execution, you will receive an object with the sent ID containing updated values. However,
    please note that no changes will be made to the actual database.
</Callout>



In the example above, we tried to update the product price and stock quantity. Now here is a sample API response

```json copy filename="API Response"
{
    "id": "64858a3114c402ee08ec6293",
    "name": "Iphone X Max",
    "description": "The iPhone X is a smartphone designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is part of the eleventh generation of the iPhone",
    "stock": 20,
    "price": 1099.99,
    "images": [

    ],
    "categories": [
